# Recognition baseline and evaluation gate

## Reproducible local baseline

- Engine: native Tesseract, English, page-segmentation mode 6.
- Model: official `tesseract-ocr/tessdata_fast` `eng.traineddata` at commit
  `87416418657359cb625c412a48b6e1d6d41c29bd`.
- Model SHA-256:
  `7d4322bd2a7749724879683fc3912cb542f19906c83bcc1a52132556427170b2`.
- Model license: Apache-2.0; upstream terms at
  https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata_fast/blob/87416418657359cb625c412a48b6e1d6d41c29bd/LICENSE .
- Docker and CI download the immutable model at build/setup time and verify its
  checksum. Runtime recognition verifies the checksum again, and source provenance
  records the actual engine version, model hash and segmentation mode.
- Test environment engine observed: Tesseract 5.3.4. Native package versions can
  differ between platforms; an engine upgrade requires rerunning the same fixtures.

## What the evidence establishes

Synthetic printed PNG, explicit 90-degree rotation recovery, two-page PDF,
malformed PDF, page limit, cancellation, candidate parsing and reviewed transactional
import are exercised by automated tests. Generated documents use no real infant
data. Engine confidence is a 0–100 recognition score, not a field-correctness
probability. No benchmark on messy family handwriting has been performed.

Tesseract's own FAQ states that it is designed for printed text and does not work
well for handwriting: https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/FAQ . The UI must retain
manual transcription and explicit approval even when recognition looks confident.

## Handwriting candidates to evaluate

| Candidate | Why evaluate | Evidence still needed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tesseract baseline | Small local CPU dependency and reproducible comparison | Field accuracy/abstention on the actual form layouts |
| PaddleOCR PP-OCRv5 local pipeline | Upstream documents recognition for complex English handwriting and page layout | Private same-fixture accuracy, resource use, installation/model license review |
| Human transcription with image review | Reliable fallback for ambiguous strokes, cross-outs and missing fields | Mobile usability and reviewer time |

Do not install an always-running model or send family documents to a hosted model
by default. A future alternate recognizer must emit the same candidate/provenance
contract and cannot commit records. Compare the same privately stored, representative
handwritten/printed forms. Report exact field match, missing-field abstention,
incorrect event split/merge, duplicate handling, review time, CPU/RAM and latency.
Do not promote a model solely on its published benchmark. Unknown values must stay
unknown until the caregiver resolves them.
